Types of Errors: Syntax, Logical and Runtime errors

Program will crash during run time errors.

Program will run except some cases. So we will handle those exception

The exception handling is a way to handle the runtime error so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained.
Exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program.It is an object which is thrown at runtime.

By default every class extends Object class. Object class has a method called toString() being used by SOUT when printing object.
When you try to print object it will print some hashcode, override the toString in your class and return whichever string you want for friendliness
  System.out.println(e); this works the same, toString method is printing the message in a format this is present in throwable class which is extendeds by Exception

 Hierarchy : I took a screenshot
 Arithmetic Exception is extending RuntimeException which in turn extends Exception and Exception extends Throwable
 Polymorphism : creating reference of parent type in which initializing object of its child

 There are multiple types of exceptions: NullPointerException, IndexOutofBoundException, IllegalArgumentException, Arithmetic

 If a block of code may throw objects of multiple typs of exceptions then it is recommended to put Exception reference type
 in the catch block.

We have seen: Exception handling, Hierarchy, Multiple catch blocks, toString()
Nested try and catch are also possible


Stack Trace: Stack trace that provides detailed information about method calls that leads to exception
each exception object has getStackTrace() method, that returns of array related to each call in call stack.
process will finished successfully if this methods written inside catch block else it disrupts the flow
e.printStackTrace(); //
e.getMessage();

Student a = null;
a.setId(123); // this is not checked by compiler it will let you do this
This is why it is called unchecked exception, they are not being checked at compile time

Some exceptions do get checked at compile time called checked exception
Eg, Unhandled exception: java.io.FileNotFoundException given by FileReader fileReader = new FileReader("a.txt");
FileNotFoundException is the subClass of IOException
If a.txt is not present then file wont be compiled.

Throws keyword: The caller statement will be responsible for exception handling, It notifies caller statement that this function
may throw an exception. It is alternative to try/catch. The throws keyword is added to the method signature followed by the
type of exception. If the function throwing error via throws is called inside another function then that exception should be handled
there also either using try/catch or throws itself.

Throw keyword: To explicitly throw an exception

closing reader object in finally block, if user made changed to files it should be closed even if there are return statement above it

After Java 7, try with came , try (line that might throw error)
