Enumeration simply means listing things
It is a fixed set of constants
Example: Months in a year, departments in a college, days in a week

public interface Days {

    String SUNDAY = "SUNDAY";                         public enum Day {
                                                          SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY                                                   }
    String MONDAY = "MONDAY";
    String TUESDAY = "TUESDAY";
    String WEDNESDAY = "WEDNESDAY";    ======>
    String THURSDAY = "THURSDAY";

}
During compile time , the enum code looks like below:
The name of the Enum becomes class, all the fields of the enum becomes instance of this class
All these instances are static final
The class becomes final so that no other class can derive it and making sure all fields of enum remain constant.
This Day class is extending the Enum
The constructor of Enum class takes the value and ordinal(index)
This class also creates a final array of all the instances

public final class Day ends java.lang.Enum<Day> {

public static final Day SUNDAY new Day("SUNDAY", 0);

public static final Day MONDAY = new Day("MONDAY", 1);

public static final Day TUESDAY new Day("TUESDAY", 2);

public static final Day WEDNESDAY = new Day("WEDNESDAY", 3);

public static final Day THURSDAY new Day("THURSDAY", 4);

public static final Day FRIDAY = new Day("FRIDAY", 5);

public static final Day SATURDAY = new Day("SATURDAY", 6);

private static final Day [] VALUES = { SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY };

private Day(String name, int ordinal) {

}

super(name, ordinal);

public static Day [] values() { return VALUES.clone();

}

public static Day valueOf(String name) {

for (Day day: VALUES) {

if (day.name().equals(name)) {

}

}

}

return day;

throw new IllegalArgumentException("No enum constant " + name);

We know everything is converted into class at compile time. We can add our methods in Enum too
When trying to add fields, we already have a constructor on Enum but we cannot pass a field value to intialize it, when we add a
field we create a constructor in same Enum that we created, that accepts the value of fields, by not just listing values but specifying their field value:
SUNDAY("sunday")
We can set the values of field by passing them on parameters of a custom constructor

We can create enum inside class also
