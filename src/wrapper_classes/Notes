Ques: Is Java a pure object oriented programming language ?
Ans: No, not all predefined types are object (primitive data types like int, float, double). We have predefined types as
non-object.

Wrapper class wraps around a primitive data type to convert it into an Object, enabling them to be used in object-oriented
context where only Objects are allowed. such as collection like arraylist.
They provide: Object representation, collection compatibility, enhanced type casting (converting strings to numbers or numbers
to string) , wrapper objects can be null, Autoboxing / Unboxing ( Java automatically converts between their primitives and wrappers)

Autoboxing : the automatic conversion of primitive type, such as int, to its corresponding wrapper object ( int to Integer).
Unboxing : Automatically converting an object of a wrapper class to its corresponding primitive type (Integer to int )

Autoboxing :        Integer i = Integer.valueOf(1); // Unnecessary boxing , Java automatically does this
          You can simply write,  Integer i = 1;

Unboxing : int i1 = i.intValue(); // Unnecessary unboxing
 You can write , int i1 = i;
