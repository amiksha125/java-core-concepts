A vector in java is a part of the java.util package and is one of the legacy classes in Java that implements the List interface.

It was introduced in JDK 1.0 before collection framework and is synchronized, making it thread-safe.

Now it is apart of Collection Framework.

However, due to its synchronization, Its generally recommended to use other modern alternatives like ArrayList
in single threaded scenarios. Despite this, vector is still useful in certain areas, particularly in multithreaded
environment where thread safety is concern.

Memory overhead due to synchronization

Key features of vector:
* Dynamic Array: Vector is a dynamic array that grows automatically when more elements are added then its current capacity.
* Synchronized: All the methods in Vector are synchronized, which makes it thread-safe. This means multiple threads can work on Vector
without the risk of corrupting data. However, this can introduce performance overhead in single-threaded environment.
* Legacy Class: Vector was part of java's original release and is considered as legacy class. It's generally recommended to use
ArrayList in single threaded environment due to performance considerations.
* Resizing Mechanism: When the current capacity of the vector is exceeded, it doubles its size by default(or increase by the capacity
increment if provided).
* Random Access: Similar to array and ArrayList, Vector allows random access to elements, making it efficient for accessing
elements using an index.

Constructors of Vector

Vector(): Creates a vector with an initial capacity of 10.
Vector(int initialCapacity): Creates a vector with the specified capacity.
Vector(int initialCapacity, int capacityIncrement): Creates a vector with an initial capacity and capacity increment(how much
the vector should grow when its capacity is exceeded).
Vector(Collection< ? extends E> c): Creates a vector containing the elements of the specified collection.

Methods in Vector

add(E a): Adds an element at the end
add(int index, E element): Inserts an element at the specified index.
get(int index): Retrives the element at the specified index.
set(int index, E element): Replaces the element at the specified index.
remove(Object o): Removes the first occurance of specified element.
remove(int index): Removes the first element at the specified index.
size(): Returns the number of elements in the vector
isEmpty(): Checks if the vector is empty.
contains(Object o): Checks if the vector contains the specified index.
clear(): Removes all elements from the vector.

Internal Implementation of Vector:
Internally, Vector uses an array to store its elements. The size of this array grows as needed when more elements are added.
The default behaviour is to double the size of the array when it runs out of space. This resizing operation is costly one
as it requires copying elements to the new, larger array.

Synchronization and Performance
Since Vector methods are synchronized, it ensures that only one thread can access the vector at a time. This makes it thread
safe but can introduce performance overhead in single-threaded environment because synchronized adds locking and unlocking
costs.

In modern Java, ArrayList is preferred over Vector when synchronization is not required. For thread-safe collections, the CopyOnWriteArrayList
or ConcurrentHashMap from the java.util.concurrent package is recommended
