Stack extends Vector

Stack is data Structure that LIFO ir FILO property
Insertion and deletion is allowed from one end oly called top.

Why Stack, till now
ArrayList: Stores data in sequential manner , and better for single threaded env, get() element in constant time
LinkedList: Better for heavy insertion and deletion operation, not efficient for accessing
Vector: Stores data in sequential manner , and better for multi threaded env, get() element in constant time

Stack: To achieve LIFO behaviour means the last element is the first you will get.
It inherits the Vector class so it is used for achieving synchronization

LIFO Structure: Stack follows the Last-In-First-Out principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.
Inheritance: Stack is a subclass of vector, which means it inherits all the features of a dynamic array but is constrained
by the Stack's LIFO nature.

// We do not get better performance in Stack or Vector as it locks resources, use CopyOnWriteArrayList
