Sorted map is an interface, If you instantiate it, It will be an anonymous class

SortedMap is an interface that extends map and guarantees that the entries are sorted based on the keys, either in
 their natural ordering or by the specific Comparator.

 If you want to sort incoming entries based on keys then use SortedMap

 TreeMap is an implementation class of SortedMap

 The internal implementation of treeMap is a red black tree, a self balancing binary search tree
 which means map.get() and map.containsKey() are in O(log n) time
 but compareValue() is not in log n because values are not sorted

 There will be no skewness in the red black black , it is always balanced, giving O(log n)

 TreeMap implements NavigableMap , and NavigableMap extends SortedMap
 SortedMap and NavigableMap are interfaces and TreeMap is an impl class
