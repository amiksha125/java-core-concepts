In Java, a Map is an Object that maps key to values. It cannot contain duplicate keys, and each key can map to at most one value.
`Think of it as a dictionary` where you look up a word(key) to find its definition(value).

For Example, wr can make a dictionary of student where roll no(key)  is mapped to student's name(value)

Roll           Name
101           Alice Johnson
102           Bob smith
103           Eva Thompson

a student cannot have two roll no but there can be two students with same name, roll no will uniquely identify each student

### Key Characteristics of Map Interface
Key-Value Pairs: Each entry in a Map consists of a key and a value.
Unique Keys: No two entries can have the same key.
One value per key: Each key maps to a single value.
Order: Some implementations maintains insertion order(LinkedHashMap), natural order(TreeMap), or no order(HashMap).




HashMap → Single thread, fastest

Hashtable → Old, fully synchronized, slow

ConcurrentHashMap → Multi-thread, modern & efficient
