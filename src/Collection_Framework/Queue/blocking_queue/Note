ArrayBlockingQueue                                                  LinkedBlockingQueue
A bounded, blocking queue backed by circular array                  optionally bounded backed by LinkedList
low memory overhead                                                 uses two separate locks for enqueue and dequeue
uses a single lock for both enqueue and dequeue operation           Higher concurrency between producer and consumer
as the number of threads increases, wait and overhead inc
more threads --> problem


More threads --> Linked
Less threads --> array
